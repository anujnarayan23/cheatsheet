Storage in k8s
Ans- 
Volumes

Volumes are a storage unit accessible to containers in a Pod. Some volume types are backed by ephemeral storage. Ephemeral storage types (for example, emptyDir, ConfigMap, and Secrets) do not persist after the Pod ceases to exist. These types are useful for storing configuration information and as scratch space for applications. You can manage your local ephemeral storage resources as you do your CPU and memory resources. Other volume types are backed by durable storage.

Persistent volumes

A PersistentVolume is a cluster resource that Pods can use for durable storage. A PersistentVolumesClaim can be used to dynamically provision a PersistentVolume backed by Compute Engine persistent disks for use in your cluster. You can also use a PersistentVolumeClaim to provision other types of backing storage like NFS.
